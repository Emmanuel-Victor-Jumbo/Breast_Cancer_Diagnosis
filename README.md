# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Machine Learning


__Project’s Aim:__
* This is an ongoing project, whose aim is to investigate different approaches of correctly diagnosing cells as cancerous or non cancerous. This is achieved by means of dataset exploration and preprocessing. Followed by the implementation, testing and comparison of different supervised and unsupervised machine learning models.

__Dataset Description:__
* This dataset consists of attributes derived from measuring a breast tumour’s cell nuclei. These attributes describe a cell’s characteristics and can be used to predict wether a cell is malignant(cancerous) or benign(NOT cancerous). This dataset is made up of 569 instances and 31 attributes which includes 1 class attribute.
